# Logistic Regression Model in C++

This project implements a logistic regression model with multiple input features from scratch in C++ for binary classification tasks. It includes methods to train the model using gradient descent, predict outputs for given inputs, and calculate the model parameters.

## Features

- Train a logistic regression model using gradient descent.
- Predict target values for new input data.
- Calculate and output model parameters (coefficients and intercept).
- Handle multiple input features and data points.
